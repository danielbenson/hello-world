# hello-world
Just another repository

Hi friend,

It appears you've stumbled across the obligatory "hello-world" repository I've created 
to get my account rolling! I'll take this opportunity to give you some background about 
myself. I've worked as both a manufacturing and a quality engineer in the medical device 
field, and currently function somewhere between those two roles professionally. My
undergraduate degree is in physics, which, along with statistics, is something I'm still
passionate about. For years, I've used "prepackaged" stats software for my day-to-day
number-crunching needs - only recently realizing the power & flexibility programming can 
bring to these tasks. 

In short, this is my sandbox for learning things like R and Python!

Thanks for stopping by,
Daniel Benson
